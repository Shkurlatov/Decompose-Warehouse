# Decompose Warehouse

The repository contains my work on self-completion of a study Task 
while taking specialized online courses for training C# developers.

An experienced Mentor checked the result and made his remarks on 
the quality of the work performed. The Task could not be completed 
until the Mentor decided that the result was up to industry standards.

The commit called “First implementation of the Task” is my original 
implementation, without any hints. All subsequent commits (if any) 
are the results of my attempts to solve Mentor's remarks and his 
suggestions for improvement the work.

According to the conditions of the school, the Mentor does not provide 
ways to solve shortcomings and sources of information. The search for 
the necessary educational information was carried out independently.
<br/><br/>

## Task Conditions

<br/><br/>
The user of your application will be a Warehouse manager.
<br/><br/>
